# UrbanSeismology_Infrasound_CGEO
This GitHub repository presents a comprehensive urban seismology project aimed at detecting and analyzing anthropogenic activities in urban areas. Leveraging the power of spectrometers and ObsPy, a Python library for seismology, this project provides valuable insights into the impact of human-induced vibrations on the urban environment.
