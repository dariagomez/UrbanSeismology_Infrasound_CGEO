# UrbanSeismology_Infrasound_CGEO
This GitHub repository presents a comprehensive urban seismology project aimed at detecting and analyzing anthropogenic activities in urban areas. Leveraging the power of spectrometers and ObsPy, a Python library for seismology, this project provides insights into the impact of human-induced vibrations on the urban environment.
Project was developed 2023 Summer in Queretaro, Mexico as part of a research programm for undergraduate students.

Clock code belongs to Thomas Lecocq SeismoRMS repository, with a number of modifications. https://github.com/ThomasLecocq/SeismoRMS
Spectrogram code was developped by the owner of this repository, send questions to: daria.gomez5378@alumnos.udg.mx

I only uploaded R95F0 AM station data as an example. This repository is expected to serve as an extra material or guide for future research in urban seismology for students, so different mseed files must work here!
Images are part of our results.
